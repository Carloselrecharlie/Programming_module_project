# Programming_module_project
Final project about the popular Iris flower data set for the Programming and Scripting module

Based on the combination of the four features shown in the set, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

The goal a this discriminant analysis like this is to produce a simple function that, given the four measurements, will
classify a flower correctly. This is the beginning of creating “predictors” in order to try to make a more educated guess 
on a record in a dataset.
